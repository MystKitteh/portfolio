            Look and listen in the game: What features (or assets) are helping to create an illusion
            of exploring a world? How simple or complex are the graphics and media?<br />
            <img src="kami/kami_01.jpg" alt="Kazeyo" class=kamiimg /> I chose Path of Kami for my
            Analysis. The game has a painted effect for everything in a distance, making it look
            like a piece of art. The music, art style, and user interface all have a cohesive theme
            that makes you feel like you’re exploring the world in which Path of Kami takes place.
            After further research, I have not been able to find the name of the world where the
            entire area takes place, but I do know it’s based in Japan. Games that the game studio,
            Captilight, took inspiration from when creating Path of Kami are Okami, Abzu, Journey,
            and various Zelda games.<br />
            <hr /> How simple or complex are the settings in the game? How far can you explore and
            what makes the settings distinctive?<br />
            <img src="kami/kami_settings.jpg" alt="Path of Kami Settings" class=kamiimg />
            <br /> I would say the settings are simple, however, after working with other indie
            games I can say that Path of Kami has more accessibility settings than the ones I’ve
            worked with in the past. However, they’re a little buggy when adjusting the screen resolution.<br />
            <hr /> What kind(s) of character(s) are you invited to control? Are you invited to be
            multiple characters? Or just one character type?<br />
            <img src="kami/kami_02.jpg" alt="Image of Kazeyo" class=kamiimg />
            <br /> In this game, you only play as Kazeyo. He is a Japanese wolf who recently passed
            away. He’s having to explore trails of the mortal and spirit world to find out where he belongs.<br />
            <hr /> How do you get to know the character(s) you are playing? What details make them
            distinctive, quirky, memorable, etc?<br />
            <img src="kami/kami_GIF.gif" alt="Kazeyo running around" class=kamiimg />
            <br /> You have a friend named Wisp who helps guide you through the game. They talk to
            you every so often when you get to specific locations in the game. Later in the game you
            find out that Wisp is Kazeyo's mom.<br />
            
            <hr /> What kinds of interactions do you have with NPC characters?<br />
            <img src="kami/kami_wisp.jpg" alt="Wisp" class=kamiimg />
            <br /> Just about zero interactions from my playthrough. The only NPC in the demo is
            Wisp who talks to you at certain locations, otherwise, you can not interact with them.<br />
            <hr /> How are you challenged as a game player in this game? What are you being asked to
            investigate, where do you get stuck, and how do you make progress in the game?<br />
            <img src="kami/kami_05.jpg"
                alt="A beautiful image of Path of Kami. Kazeyo is running through the cherry blossums in the night."
                class=kamiimg />
            <br /> The challenge of this game is figuring out where to go since there is not a very
            clear indication. I stopped during the demo since I could not find the way and after
            looking into other reviews it seems that I am not alone.<br />
            <hr /> What kinds of objects do you interact with in the game? Do you pick up written
            messages, do you ever need to consume food in the game, do you pick up functional things
            you need to get other things to work?<br />
            <img src="kami/kami_04.jpg" alt="The image of finding a Magatama Bead" class=kamiimg />
            <br /> I can interact with core objects that are placed in the wolf's mouth. Those items
            have to be placed on a platform somewhere nearby. You can also interact with these weird
            rainbow items. I have no idea what they’re for since the game did not explain it. You
            can also interact with little fireplaces. When you add fire to them it will either move
            an object or make one appear. The last thing you can interact with is these little pools
            that become your spawn points in case you fall into a larger body of water.<br /> <hr/>

            <hr /> Comment on the music and sounds in the game!<br />
            <div class="audio-container"><audio controls src="kami/PathofKamiOST-MarkChoi.mp3">
                    <a href="kami/PathofKamiOST-MarkChoi.mp3"></a>
                </audio><br /></div> The music is wonderfully composed by <a
                href="https://www.choiby.com/">Mark Choi</a>! The OST gives such a blissful,
            relaxing, and spiritual atmosphere for the game. My only nitpick is that the music does
            not loop well at all in the game. The game’s music would have long pauses between the
            tracks. <br />
            <hr /> Speculate: How could this game develop in the future, or what would be an
            improvement the developers could make in the next stage?<br />
            <img src="kami/kami_07.jpg" alt="Kazeyo is having back problems" class=kamiimg />
            <br /> If Captilight took Path of Kami back in development, then they could improve on
            making the story and gameplay more understandable. The only character that you interact
            with in the demo is Wisp and they do not give you too much information on what is going
            on. The developers want the players to assume and look deep into the objects to figure
            out the story, but it does not work well for this game. The game needs more dialogue, a
            better understanding of what the objects mean, and more NPCs to make the world come to
            life. The mechanics could use some work. The way Kazeyo jumps feels too floaty and
            stiff. Let the players know what key or button is used for the fire ability. It is
            unclear what the objectives of the game are. Having a map, indicator, or anything that
            could draw the player's attention could make the game more comprehensible. Players have
            to guess where objects need to go to continue the game. The background music loops but
            does so harshly. The music needs a smoother transition for it to feel pleasant. A few of
            the sound effects in the game do not feel like they belong to the item, updating those
            will help make the world feel more immersive. A lot of the objective and user problems
            could be solved with help tips. The puzzles need to be amped up. Currently, you carry an
            object from one place to another. All in all the game needs an upgrade if they want
            people to understand the story and have more people to view the game. I do love the
            world they built, but I just wish it haad a bit more love in some areas of the game.<br />
