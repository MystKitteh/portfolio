            Look and listen in the game: What features (or assets) are helping to create an illusion of exploring a world? How simple or complex are the graphics and media? <br/>
            I chose Path of Kami for my Analysis. The game has a painted effect for everything in a distance making it look like a piece of art. The music, art style, and user interface all have a cohesive theme that makes you feel like you’re exploring the world that Kami is placed in(I need to go back and find the name). <br/>
            
            <br/>
            How simple or complex are the settings in the game? How far can you explore and what makes the settings distinctive? <br/>
            I would say the settings are simple, however working with other indies this game had more accessible settings than the ones I’ve worked with in the past. However, they’re a little buggy when it comes to adjusting the screen resolution. <br/>
            <br/>
            What kind(s) of character(s) are you invited to control? Are you invited to be multiple characters? Or just one character type? <br/>
            In this game, you only play as Kami. He is a Japanese wolf who recently passed away. He’s having to explore trails of the mortal and spirit world to find out where he belongs. <br/>
            <br/>
            How do you get to know the character(s) you are playing? What details make them distinctive, quirky, memorable, etc? <br/>
            You have a friend named Wisp who helps guide you through everything. However, most of my information came from the steam description. <br/>
            <br/>
            What kinds of interactions do you have with NPC characters? <br/>
            Just about zero interactions. The only NPC in the demo is Wisp whom talks to you at certain locations, otherwise, you can not interact with them. <br/>
            <br/>
            How are you challenged as a game player in this game? What are you being asked to investigate, where do you get stuck, and how do you make progress in the game? <br/>
            The challenge of this game is figuring out where to go since there is not a very clear indication. I ended up stopping during the demo since I could not find the way. I’ll go back and try again before the final version is due. <br/>
            <br/>
            What kinds of objects do you interact with in the game? Do you pick up written messages, do you ever need to consume food in the game, do you pick up functional things you need to get other things work? <br/>
            I can interact with core objects that are placed in the wolf's mouth. Those items have to then be placed on a platform somewhere nearby. You can also interact with these weird rainbow items. I have no idea what they’re for since the game did not explain it. You can also interact with little fireplaces. When you add fire to them it will either move an object or make one appear. The last thing you can interact with is these little pools that become your spawn points in case you fall into a larger body of water. <br/>
            <br/>
            Comment on the music and sounds in the game!  <br/>
            The music fit the game very well however, it did not loop well at all. The game’s music would have long pauses between the tracks. <br/>
            <br/>
            Speculate: How could this game develop in the future, or what would be an improvement the developers could make in a next stage? <br/>
            <br/>
            Outline: <br/>
            Just more things to do in every area <br/>
            Add more NPCs to interact with <br/>
            Make jumping smoother <br/>
            Make objectives way more clear <br/>
            Fix the music tracks <br/>
            Change some of the sound effects <br/>
            Have help tips on new items found <br/>
            Let the user carry more than one main item at a time since some of the turn in spots are a bit far from one another <br/>
            Make the puzzles more interesting <br/>
