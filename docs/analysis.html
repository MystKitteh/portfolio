        <div class="text">I have chosen to compare Lord of the Rings by Tolken with Dracula by Stolker. I think it would be neat to compare these two since they’re both works of fiction and have fantasy characters involved. I find it interesting that both Dracula and Lord of the Rings have a phrase they use frequently that’s very similar to one another. In Dracula they use I could not 68 times and in Lord of the Rings they use I do not 212 times.
