                    <b>Lord of the Rings</b><br/>
                    Average Words Per Sentence: 12.1<br/>

                I dug around and found the phrase "The lord of the" popping up pretty often in the text. Which that is not surprising to hear since the book is called Lord of the Rings, however I was not expecting the Lord of the <i>Mark</i> to be the main follow up word. Now I'm not deep into Lord of the Rings so I'm sure Mark is something fans would think would be normal.
                <img src="images/thelordofthe.png" alt="Lord of the phrase" style="width:500px; border: 3px solid  #006335; box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);" /><br/>
                Another interesting find was that the main two 4 word phrases are <i>I don't know</i> and <i>I do not know</i>. They have similar amounts of frequency with one of them being at 67 and the other being at 66. The characters are clearly uncertain about many things.
                <img src="images/idontknow.png" alt="The frequency and what shows up around the cluster I don't know" style="width:500px; border: 3px solid  #006335; box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);" /><br/>
               I figured ring would show up a bit, so I was curious on what the clusters might look like. I was not surprised with the results, especially the number 1 slot.  <i>Ring to rule</i> is what popped up the most, so given that one of the main phrases I hear from people is "The ring to rule them all" this was to be expected.

                <img src="images/ring2.png" alt="Shows that Ring appears 499 times and what words it shows up next to." style="width:250px; border: 3px solid  #006335; box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);" /><br/>
                With both texts involving some dark themes I decided to see which talked more about death. <i>Death</i> shows up 127 times out of 484763 times. Thus making it around 2% of the text.
                <img src="images/lotrdeath.png" alt="The amount of times Death appears in The Lord of the Rings text" style="width:500px; border: 3px solid  #006335; box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);" /><br/>

                <b>Dracula</b><br/>
                    Average Words Per Sentence: 18.5<br/>
                    Top 5 most frequent words in the corpus:<br/>
                    said (570); shall (427); know (396); time (390); come (339)<br/>
                    Most frequent phrases three word phrases:<br/>

                <img src="images/dractext.png" alt="Dracula text bubble" style="width:500px; border: 3px solid  #006335; box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);" /><br/>
                The very first thing I wanted to know was how many times did <i>Dracula</i> show up in the text. Honestly, it was a bit lower than I expected. <i>Dracula</i> only shows up 34 times throughout the text.
                <img src="images/dracula.png" alt="Dracula shows up 34 times in the text" style="width:500px; border: 3px solid  #006335; box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);" /><br/>
                Lord of the Rings is not the only text with characters that do not know what's going on. Dracula has a total of 30 clusters that show <i>I do not know</i> and <i>I don't know.</i><br/>
                <img src="images/dngram.png" alt="Dracula characters saying I don't know or I do not know" style="width:500px; border: 3px solid  #006335; box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);" /><br/>
                Of course I needed to see how many times <i>vampire</i> appears in a book about Dracula. Vampire shows up 28 times which is also less than I expected.
                <img src="images/vampire.png" alt="Vampire frequency" style="width:500px; border: 3px solid  #006335; box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);" /><br/>
                Now it was time to compare Dracula with Lord of the Rings. I wanted to see how many times <i>death</i> was mentioned in both. Dracula mentions <i>death</i> 95 out of 162845. Making that about 5% of the text being about <i>death</i>.
                <img src="images/ddeath.png" alt="Death being mentioned in Dracula" style="width:500px; border: 3px solid  #006335; box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);" /><br/>
