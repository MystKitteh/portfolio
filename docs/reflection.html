            <p> The most significant challenge for new learners with WordPress would be going
                through all the settings to see what happens when each option is adjusted. The most
                challenging part of HTML/CSS would be the debugging process. For a new learner, it
                would be learning what the code means. The advantage of WordPress is that you can
                create a professional-looking website quickly. However, you have a lot more freedom
                to make the website exactly as you prefer if you use HTML/CSS. Messing with the
                layout is a bit annoying with both formats. In WordPress, youâ€™re typically stuck to
                the template, and with HTML/CSS you have to deal with debugging your grid or
                learning new code. Having patience is a very important skill for both formats. I
                need to learn JavaScript to help make my websites look a bit more professional. </p>
